THIS IS THE NOTES APP, made in pygame.
It has new file, save file and open file functionality.
Things left to do are settings, and copy-paste.
Moreoever, there can be a change in the core mechanism of the app, which is ins
tead of having lines, we have cells which hold only singular characters, thus m
aking copy-paste easier, but open, and save harder.
I'm thinking of making this open-source, just to see how far this goes.
